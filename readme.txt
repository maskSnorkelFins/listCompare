listCompare

Copy/paste two lists of names and press the Compare! button to find name matches.  First list is saved in your browser's local storage for easy repeat use.
- names must have at least 2 parts (firstname & lastname)
- each name can be forwards or reveresed, including comma-separated (lastname, firstname)
- no need to "scrub" each list, special characters are automatically removed, so copy/paste from any source, including a spreadsheet


Planned Changes
- add sensitivity adjustment
- switch to regex to remove special characters
- change list names to list1, list2
- add "click to confirm" for close matches


Getting Started
This script works great right here, hosted on GitHub.io.  Feel free to download, adapt and install on another server.
